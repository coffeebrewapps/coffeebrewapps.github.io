  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Khoon from Sunny Singapore! I’ve created coffeebrewapps.com as a personal passion project.</p>
  <p>
  As a software engineer, I enjoy using programming as a problem-solving tool for my everyday life.
  It all started a few years back. As a result of the pandemic, I was at home most of the day, so I spent a lot of time
  playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons (referred to as ACNH thereafter). It was hard to remember when the fishes and
  critters appear in the day, so I built a simple SPA to help me keep track of them. I was so obsessed with the game
  that I ended up creating 4 apps for it! It was fun, both playing ACNH and building the companion apps.
  </p>
  <p>
  Fast-forward a few years to today, I continue to use programming to help with other areas of my life, for example, 
  personal finance management, and that’s where you will notice that I have quite a number of finance-related projects
  in my portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
  These apps have been sitting in my personal Github for quite some time, but I thought they might be useful to others 
  who have similar problems to solve in their life. So, I decided to setup this site as a sort of directory to these
  apps to make discovery easier.
  </p>
  <p>
  Aside from the apps directory, I will also write some articles as a sort of journal for my journey as a software
  engineer. I don’t intend them to be technical advice for other engineers, because I believe there’s no shortage of
  great technical articles already existing in the market for that purpose. What I wish to achieve with the writing is
  to help me solidify things I’ve learnt, and allow me to easily refer back to them when I need them. It will keep me
  motivated on this journey as I look back at all the new things I’ve learnt and built along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
  I hope you will enjoy your visit to this site. Now, let me go grab another cup of coffee and continue coding. ☕
