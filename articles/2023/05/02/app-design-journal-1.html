<p>I haven’t confirmed the name of the app that I was going to build, but I can’t do anything without a name for the code
repo, so for now I’ll codename it “Triple Tee App”. Where do the 3 T’s come from? It’s “Tag”, “Transaction” and “Tax”.
Not very creative, isn’t it?</p>

<p>If I can’t think of a better name than this, I might just end up sticking to it, because thinking of a name is a very
brain-damaging activity. (laugh)</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-app-structure">Setting Up The App Structure</h2>

<p>It turns out that figuring out the app structure is not so simple, because JS.</p>

<p>Spent about a day setting up the structure of the repo so that the server, client and Electron wrapper all work
together properly.</p>

<p>The first thing I learnt about from this exercise was that there’re currently 2 ways to modularise JS modules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CommonJS: default of Node.js</li>
  <li>ES Modules: standardised approach supported by major browsers</li>
</ul>

<p>I will spare you the details of the difference between the 2, because there are already a lot of articles out there
for that purpose. But I want to talk a little more about how I dealt with the mix of use of both approaches in my app.</p>

<p>First of all, although it was recommended that we use ES Modules for a new project, in the end I had to go with CommonJS
because Electron has no ESM support. There’s a library called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build-electron</code> I stumbled upon which can help build the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.js</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preload.js</code> of Electron from ESM into CommonJS for Electron to run the app. But just by using this tool,
I had to include 3 other dependencies and complicate my build pipeline. I decided to keep it simple and stick with
CommonJS.</p>

<p>Then there’s the server-side code, where I use Express.js as the framework. Before I learnt about CommonJS vs ESM, the
tutorial I read about Express.js is in CommonJS, so I already started working on some scaffolding in CommonJS. Since
Node.js supports CommonJS by default, I didn’t think of changing it to ESM because then I had to change all my existing
code to use ESM syntax.</p>

<p>Finally, I use Vue.js for my client-side code. Now, Vue.js uses ESM by default, and I had created a scaffold app and
successfully run it together with my Express.js server code. It turns out that Vue.js uses Babel under the hood to
compile ESM to CommonJS anyway.</p>

<p>So in the end, I just decided to stick to CommonJS for my server code and Electron wrapper, and use the default ESM
for client code. It’s a little confusing if it’s a single person coding both server and client, but if we think about
it from the point of view of having a backend engineer code the server, and a frontend engineer code the client, then
there’s actually no issue with it, I think.</p>

<p>Of course I still wish to standardise the modularisation of this app to ESM, but if I had continued to dig deeper into
figuring out how to make it work, I think I wouldn’t be able to finish the app within the timeline. Sometimes there’re
just compromises to be made in order to actually achieve a goal, otherwise the idea will just remain an idea without
something concrete to show for it, right?</p>

<p>Here’s the end result of the folder structure after considering the modularisation approach.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">client</code>: This is where the Vue.js code sits.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out</code>: This is where Electron will build the app distributables into.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code>: This is where the Vue.js assets will be built into and served by Express.js.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server</code>: This is where the Express.js code sits.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">common.js</code>: This is where I write some shared functions and constants to use across the app.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.js</code>: This is the entry point for Electron to run the app.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preload.js</code>: This is where Electron run some code before rendering the app.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server.js</code>: This is the entry point for Node.js to run the server.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-form-elements">Some Form Elements</h2>

<p>Now that the most important part of setting up the folder structure is out of the way, it’s time to get down to writing
the code for the app.</p>

<p>To know that I’ve made some progress, I started working on the most obvious thing first: the UI elements, so that I can
see it concretely materialise before my eyes.</p>

<p>Spent about half a day building the input and button elements using Vue components. This time I decided to not use
Vuetify as a challenge for myself to style my app without existing framework, and also I want to reduce the bloat of
my app as much as possible by using as few dependencies as my skills can allow for.</p>

  </div>
  <p><small>Not too bad, it’s quite close to what I designed in the wireframes.</small></p>
</div>

<h2 id="thats-all-for-now">That’s All For Now</h2>

<p>That’s the result after 2 days of work, I think I’ve made pretty good progress so far. Hopefully from now one I don’t
have to deal with anymore framework related issues, and can focus on building the app itself.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
